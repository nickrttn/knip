        Knip is a powerful tool that helps thousands of developers keep their
        JavaScript and TypeScript projects lean and maintainable. Knip saves
        teams valuable time and resources.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the creator and primary maintainer, I'm dedicated to the continued
        development and support of Knip. With my deep expertise in JavaScript
        and TypeScript, its ecosystem, frameworks and tooling, I ensure Knip
        remains best-in-class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your sponsorship directly funds the development of new features, bug
        fixes, and performance improvements in Knip. It allows me to spend more
        time enhancing this valuable open-source tool
        <a href="#projects-using-knip">relied upon by many</a> in the JavaScript
        community.
